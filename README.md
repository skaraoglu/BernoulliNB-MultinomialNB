# NaiveBayes

In this assignment; we implement two Naive Bayes event models, Bernoulli and Multinomial. Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers are trained and tested on different datasets. We present the accuracy scores for both Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers on different datasets and compare them to see which model performed better.
